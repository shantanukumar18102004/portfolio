    <h3>overdrop</h3>
    <p> Overdrop has a simple, easy-to-understand interface with a reasonable, if somewhat limited, selection. You can see the current weather, hourly weather, the air quality, a radar map, and weekly forecast; select a drop-down arrow to get more details. However, its main advantage may be that, if you’re a paying customer, you can access 54 different weather widgets — something that widget fans may find worth the price. At the time of the review, you could choose between Open Weather Map, Dark Sky, or Weatherbit if you used the free version; paid subscribers can also select AccuWeather.</p>
